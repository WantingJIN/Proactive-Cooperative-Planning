MPC
Scenario: one robot and one human in corridor

Planning strategy: Proactive planning

Optimization parameter: control input of the robot x=[u,v];


Launch: MPC_main_disabled.m


Cost function:
f1: sum of the distance between the goal position and the current robot position of each time iteration
f2: sum of the robot control input in each time iteraction
f3: human confort : sum of the interation force generated by the robot and the wall(or penalty cost function for the distance to the wall)


Constriant:
g1: distance between the person and the robot should be bigger than the sum of the radius+0.1
g2: Directional constriant
g3: safty constraint for robot to keep away from the wall
g4: Time to collision
g5: safty constraint for human to not be pushed to crash the wall


parameter tune:
A B As Bs: When robot already give the space to human, human should not react and also give the way. When robot do not give the space to human, human should react smoothly and naturely.

Aw Bw: When robot may push human very close to the wall, the robot should realize it and let the human pass by the outside, when needed to let the person go near to the wall, the human should act properly
